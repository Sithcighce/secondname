      "english": "Did you know how casual DIY mascara can be in an Australian bulk store? I found my mascara dried out and couldn't be used anymore. Since the ingredients aren't too complicated, I decided to DIY a new one at the bulk store. The store even provides free containers. I started with the base oil for the mascara, which was coconut yogurt a month ago. Today, I opened a new bucket of shea butter and used my favorite ice cream scoop. 😊 They say adding aloe vera gel to the mascara makes it less likely to flake. Finally, I added the main ingredient of homemade mascara, which is either called almonds or almonds. 😄",
      "chinese": "你们知道在澳洲的干粮店DIY睫毛膏能有多随吗？我发现我的睫毛膏已经干得不能用了。由于成分并不复杂，我决定在干粮店自制一支新的睫毛膏。这家店还提供免费的瓶子。我先从睫毛膏的底油开始，一个月前这还是干椰酸奶的状态。今天我新开了一桶乳木果油，还用上了我最喜欢的冰淇淋勺。😊听说睫毛膏里加点芦荟胶就不会那么容易起块。最后，我加入了自制睫毛膏的主要成分，也就是那个不知道叫巴旦木还是杏仁的东西。😄",

      "english": "After preparing all the ingredients, I bought special empty bottles for mascara. I started by soaking the almonds in hot water to make peeling them as easy as breathing. I felt like I had already given two performances today. I put the almonds in a pan and kept stirring according to the recipe until they turned black. Making this mascara really came with the risk of triggering a fire alarm. Then, I had to crush the burnt almonds, which looked just like sesame paste after being mashed. 😊",
      "chinese": "准备好所有材料后，我又买了专门做睫毛膏的空瓶。先将杏仁泡在热水中，据说这样脱皮就像呼吸一样轻松。感觉今天已经够忙活的了。我把杏仁下入锅中，按照食谱上说的不断翻炒，直至它们变黑。做这个睫毛膏真是冒着火警的风险。然后，我将炒糊的杏仁碾碎，看起来就像芝麻糊一样。😊",

      "english": "Next, I melted the shea butter over a water bath and began the final mixing. I added some oil and the almond paste. I initially thought I could use a straw to pour the mixture into the molds, but it didn't work. In a moment of inspiration, I used a piping bag. 😊 Despite the mess, I managed to fill nine mascara bottles. Tomorrow morning, I'll try them out when I do my makeup. 😄 Without me telling you, could you tell which eye has been brushed with mascara and which hasn't? 🤔",
      "chinese": "接着，我用水浴法融化了乳木果油，开始最后的调配。我加入了一些油和杏仁糊。本想用吸管将混合物倒入模具，但吸了半天也没吸进去。急中生智，我用上了裱花袋。😊尽管一地鸡毛，我终于灌满了9根睫毛膏。明天早上化妆时，我会试用一下这些睫毛膏。😄如果不我说，你能分清楚哪只眼睛刷了睫毛膏，哪只没刷吗？🤔",
